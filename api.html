                <h1>Writing Pregel+ Application Programs</h1>

            </div>

        </div>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p>This webpage details the concrete APIs that users are interested in when writing application codes. We assume that users are already familiar with the basic concepts of the system; if not, we recommend you to read the <a href="overview.html" target="_blank">system architecture overview</a> first.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>How to Run a Pregel Job?</h2>
		
		<p>Pregel+ supports three modes, which corresponds to different worker and vertex classes. We summarize them below:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p><b>Basic Mode:</b> include "basic/pregel-dev.h" and subclass the "Vertex" and "Worker" classes.</p>
		
			<p><b>Mirroring Mode:</b> include "ghost/ghost-dev.h" and subclass the "GVertex" and "GWorker" classes.</p>
			
			<p><b>Req-Resp Mode:</b> include "reqresp/req-dev.h" and subclass the "RVertex" and "RWorker" classes.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<p>All worker classes have a <b>run()</b> function, which is called by users to start the specified job:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>void run(const WorkerParams & params)</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<p>Here, the object of type <b>WorkerParams</b> is defined in <b>utils/global.h</b> with the following fields:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>string input_path;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//HDFS data path of the input graph</p>
			
			<p>string output_path;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//output path on HDFS</p>
			
			<p>bool force_write;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//whether to overwrite to output path if it exists</p>
			
			<p>bool native_dispatcher;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//whether the input graph is written by another Pregel+ job&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//if it's true, loading can be optimized; though it always works if native_dispatcher is false</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<p>Two other functions defined in <b>utils/global.h</b> are also important for job running:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>init_workers()</p>
			
			<p>worker_finalize()</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<p>The first function should be called at the beginning of your <b>main()</b> function so that each process (worker) gets its worker ID; while the second function should be called at the end of <b>main()</b> to indicate the termination of the MPI program.</p>
		
		<p>In between them, users should specify parameters like the input/output path in <b>param</b> properly, and call <b>run(param)</b> of your worker to start the job.</p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>Global API</h2>
		
		<p>The following variables/functions are defined in <b>utils/global.h</b>, and can be used everywhere in your program.</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>int _my_rank;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//the worker ID of the current process, set by init_workers()</p>
			
			<p>int _num_workers;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//the total number of workers, set by init_workers()</p>
			
			<p>int get_worker_id()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//get _my_rank</p>
			
			<p>int get_num_workers()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//get _num_workers</p>
			
			<p>worker_barrier()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//wait till all workers reach this line of code</p>
			
			<p>step_num()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//get the current superstep number (starting from 1)</p>
			
			<p>set_combiner()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//the input is an object of your Combiner subclass</p>
			
			<p>set_aggregator()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//the input is an object of your Aggregator subclass</p>
			
			<p>void* getAgg()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//get the aggregated value from the previous superstep, should be cast by (FinalT *)</p>
			
			<p>int get_vnum()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//get the total vertex number</p>
			
			<p>int active_vnum()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//get the total number of active vertices</p>
			
			<p>wakeAll()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//setting all vertices to be active for the next superstep</p>
			
			<p>forceTerminate()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//once called, the job terminates after the current superstep ends</p>
						
		</div>
		
		<p>Among them, <b>_my_rank</b> is usually used for debugging. For example, if you want to print some information to the screen, and you just want the master to print, you may add the following statement in your code:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>if(_my_rank == MASTER_RANK)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&lt;&lt;your_information&lt;&lt;endl;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//MASTER_RANK is 0</p>
						
		</div>
		
		<p>The functions <b>set_combiner()</b> and <b>set_aggregator()</b> are usually called in your <b>main()</b> function before calling <b>run()</b> of your worker. Note, however, that the Aggregator subclass still need to be specified as the second argument of the Worker class that you subclass.</p>
		
		<p>The function <b>step_num()</b> is usually called in <b>Vertex::compute()</b>, <b>Aggregator::stepParital()</b> and <b>Aggregator::stepFinal()</b> to branch for different operations. For example, the operation performed in the first superstep is usually different from the rest since there are no incoming messages. In this case, we can branch in <b>compute()</b> like: </p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>if(step_num() == 1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{...}</p>
			
			<p>else&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{...}</p>
						
		</div>
		
		<p>The function <b>getAgg()</b> is usually called in <b>Vertex::compute()</b> and <b>Aggregator::init()</b>. For example, for a cumulative aggregator that aggregates over all supersteps, we set the current aggregated value to be the return value of <b>getAgg()</b> in <b>Aggregator::init()</b>. However, we usually do not call it in the first superstep since no aggregation is done before. The function is usually called like:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>FinalT* agg_val = (FinalT *)getAgg();</p>
			
			<p>//use "agg_val->some_field" later</p>
						
		</div>
		
		<p>The function <b>forceTerminate()</b> is usually called in <b>Vertex::compute()</b> and <b>Aggregator::finishFinal()</b> to terminate the job earlier when some end condition is met, such as when the target vertex is met when BFS from the source vertex for computing point-to-point reachability.</p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>Vertex API</h2>
		
		<p>The Vertex class contains four template arguments:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p><b>KeyT</b>: type of vertex ID</p>
			
			<p><b>ValueT</b>: type of vertex value, such as its state and adjacency list(s)</p>
			
			<p><b>MessageT</b>: type of the messages that a vertex sends</p>
			
			<p><b>HashT</b>: the hash function type</p>
						
		</div>
		
		<p>Here, <b>KeyT</b> is the type of vertex ID, which is usually integer (e.g. int, long long). One may also use <b>VertexID</b> which is defined as int in <b>utils/global.h</b>. However, <b>KeyT</b> does not have to be integer, and it can be of any user-defined type as long as the following requirements are met.</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>1. Operator <b>&lt;</b> is overloaded for <b>KeyT</b>. This is used by the system to sort messages in the message buffer by target vertex, before performing message combining. For basic types, the comparators are already defined.</p>
			
			<p>2. (De)serialization function is defined for <b>KeyT</b>.</p>
			
			<p>3. <b>__gnu_cxx::hash&lt;KeyT&gt;</b> is defined with operator <b>()</b> overloaded indicating the hashing logic. When a message targeted at vertex <b>v</b> arrives at the receiving worker, the worker looks up <b>v</b>'s incoming message buffer from a hash table to insert the message, and thus <b>hash(KeyT)</b> should be defined. For basic types, the hash functions are already defined by g++.</p>
			
			<p>4. One should define a type <b>HashT</b> with operator <b>()</b> overloaded indicating how to compute the machine ID from the vertex ID. The type <b>HashT</b> is then provided as the fourth template argument of the Vertex class. For integer types, one may not specify the template argument <b>HashT</b>, and if so, <b>DefaultHash&lt;KeyT&gt;</b> defined in <b>basic/Vertex.h</b> will be used.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<p>We have defined two other types <b>intpair</b> (with  <b>HashT</b> =  <b>IntPairHash</b>) and <b>inttriplet</b> (with  <b>HashT</b> =  <b>IntTripletHash</b>) in <b>utils/type.h</b>, which are be directly used as <b>KeyT</b> for the Vertex class. To define other key types, one may take these two types for reference. In our <a href="download.html" target="_blank">"Biconnected Component"</a> application code, we actually use these types as vertex key, and one may check the usage by studying it.</p>
		
		<p>The Vertex class has the following variables/functions, which are usually used in <b>Vertex::compute()</b>, <b>Worker::toVertex()</b> and <b>Worker::toline()</b>.</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>KeyT id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//vertex ID field</p>
			
			<p>ValueT& value()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//vertex value field</p>
			
			<p>bool is_active()</p>
			
			<p>void activate()</p>
			
			<p>void vote_to_halt()</p>
			
			<p>void send_message(const KeyT & tgt, const MessageT & msg)</p>
			
			<p>void add_vertex(VertexT * v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//one may call "new VertexT" to create a new vertex to add, it will be moved to the right worker in the next superstep</p>
						
		</div>
		
		<p>For simplicity, we do not implement <b>delete_vertex(v)</b>, since physical deletion of <b>v</b> can usually be replaced by voting <b>v</b> to halt and never activating it again (e.g. never sending messages to <b>v</b>). Edge addition/deletion can be directly done by manipulating the adjacency list field of <b>value()</b>.</p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>Worker API</h2>
		
		<p>The Worker class contains two template arguments:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p><b>VertexT</b>: the user-defined Vertex subclass</p>
			
			<p><b>AggregatorT</b>: the user-defined Aggregator subclass</p>
						
		</div>
		
		<p>One may not specify <b>AggregatorT</b> if aggregator is not used, in which case the default <b>DummyAgg</b> defined by <b>utils/Aggregator.h</b> is specified.</p>
		
		<p>As we discussed in <a href="overview.html" target="_blank">system architecture overview</a>, the Worker class has the following two vertex loading/dumping functions for users to specify:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>VertexT* toVertex(char* line)</p>

			<p>void toline(VertexT* v, BufferedWriter& writer)</p>

		</div>
		
		<p>In <b>toVertex(.)</b>, one may call "new VertexT" to create a vertex object, set its fields properly according to the line representing it, and return the vertex (to the system). To parse the line, one may use C++ stringstream which requires copying the line string to the internal buffer of the stringstream object. A more efficient method is to use the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/strtok_r" target="_target"><b>strtok(.)</b></a> or <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/strtok_r" target="_target"><b>strtok_r(.)</b></a> functions. See any of our <a href="download.html" target="_target">application code</a> for the detailed usage.</p>
		
		<p>In <b>toline(v, writer)</b>, one have access to a writer of type <b>BufferedWriter</b>, which is defined in <b>utils/ydhdfs.h</b>. The writer has a function <b>BufferedWriter::write(char * str)</b>, which is called to write a string content to the output path on HDFS. One may construct the string content representing vertex <b>v</b> and call <b>writer.write(.)</b> to output it (possibly appending "\n"). See any of our <a href="download.html" target="_target">application code</a> for the detailed usage.</p>
	
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>GVertex API</h2>
		
		<p>For the mirroring mode, we only discuss the API of <b>GVertex</b>. The API of <b>GWorker</b> is similar to that of <b>Worker</b> (though <b>run()</b> is implemented differently) and is thus omitted.</p>
		
		<p>Unlike the Vertex class, GVertex isolates the adjacency list from the vertex value field, and requires that the adjacency list be of type <b>vector&lt;EdgeT&gt;</b> and stores all out-neighbors. Accordingly, GVertex has the following template arguments:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p><b>KeyT</b>: type of vertex ID</p>
			
			<p><b>ValueT</b>: type of vertex value, now without adjacency list</p>
			
			<p><b>MessageT</b>: type of the messages that a vertex sends</p>
			
			<p><b>EdgeT</b>: the type of edge value; accordingly, the adjacency list is of type vector&lt;EdgeT&gt;</p>
			
			<p><b>HashT</b>: the hash function type</p>
						
		</div>
		
		<p>If we do not need any value field for each edge (other than the neighbor vertex ID), we do not need to specify <b>EdgeT</b>. In this case, the default edge type <b>DefaultGEdge&lt;KeyT, MessageT&gt;</b> (defined in <b>ghost/GVertex.h</b>) is used, which only contains one field <b>id</b> indicating the neighbor ID. On the contrary, if each edge has a field (e.g. edge weight) of type <b>EValT</b>, one should specify <b>EdgeT</b> as:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>GEdge&lt;KeyT, MessageT, EValT&gt;</p>
						
		</div>
		
		<p>The GEdge is also defined in <b>ghost/GVertex.h</b>, and has two fields: (1) <b>id</b> of type <b>KeyT</b> indicating the neighbor ID, and (2) <b>eval</b> of type <b>EValT</b> indicating the edge value.</p>
		
		<p>Both <b>DefaultGEdge</b> and <b>GEdge</b> has a function that performs nothing:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>void relay(MessageT& msg)</p>
						
		</div>
		
		This function can be overloaded with other logic by subclassing <b>DefaultGEdge</b> and <b>GEdge</b>, and it indicates how to post-process the message <b>msg</b> sent along the current edge. We will return to <b>relay()</b> see its usage soon.
		
		<p>The GVertex class has similar variables/functions as the Vertex class, with slight differences. Firstly, <b>send_message(tgt, msg)</b> is no longer supported. Instead, users can call the following function in <b>GVertex::compute()</b>:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>void broadcast(const MessageT & msg)</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<p>Usually, <b>msg</b> is a vertex state maintained by <b>GVertex::value()</b>. However, sometimes the message value also depends on the value of the edge that it is sent along. For example, when computing single-source shortest paths, each vertex maintains a field <b>dist</b> indicating its current distance estimation to the source <b>s</b>. If a vertex <b>u</b>'s distance estimation gets updated by the incoming messages, it should notify all its neighbors about the state change by calling:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>broadcast(value().dist)</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<p>However, the receiver <b>v</b> should not just receive <b>u</b>'s distance estimation to <b>s</b>, but rather to obtain the distance estimation from <b>v</b> to <b>s</b> (through <b>u</b>). In this case, we need to add the message value by the length of edge <b>(u, v)</b>, and this is what <b>EdgeT::relay(msg)</b> does. See our <a href="download.html" target="_blank">application code</a> [Mirroring Mode] -> [SSSP] for the detailed usage.</p>
		
		<p>For simplicity, we do not allow <b>add_vertex(v)</b> in the mirroring mode.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, since one may need to initialize adjacency list in <b>GWorker::toVertex(line)</b>, the GVertex class has one additional function to return the adjacency list:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>EdgeContainer& neighbors()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//<b>GVertex::EdgeContainer</b> is defined as <b>vector&lt;EdgeT&gt;</b></p>
			
		</div>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>RVertex API</h2>
		
		<p>For the request-respond mode, we only discuss the additional API of <b>RVertex</b> besides that of <b>Vertex</b>. The API of <b>RWorker</b> is similar to that of <b>Worker</b> (though <b>run()</b> is implemented differently) and is thus omitted.</p>
		
		<p><b>RVertex&lt;KeyT, ValueT, MessageT, RespondT, HashT&gt;</b> contains a template argument <b>RespondT</b> indicating the type of the response. In one superstep, a vertex can call the following functions in order to make responses ready for use in the next superstep:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>void request(KeyT & tgt)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//<b>data pulling:</b> if <b>u</b> calls <b>request(v)</b>, the response from <b>v</b> will be available to <b>u</b> in the next superstep</p>
			
			<p>void exp_respond(KeyT & tgt)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//<b>data pushing (explicit responding):</b> if <b>v</b> calls <b>exp_respond(u)</b>, the response from <b>v</b> will be available to <b>u</b> in the next superstep</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<p>If the above functions are called in the previous superstep, a vertex can call the following functions to get the response:</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>RespondT get_respond(KeyT& tgt)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//to obtain <b>tgt</b>'s response; this function is unsafe and users should guarantee that the response exist</p>
			
			<p>RespondT* get_respond_safe(KeyT& tgt)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//the safe version: if there is no response from <b>tgt</b>, it returns NULL; otherwise, it returns the address of the received response</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<p>Currently, we have not discussed how to specify what a vertex should respond. The response is usually a state of the requested/responding vertex, users specify it by implementing the following abstract function in their RVertex subclass</p>
		
		<div class="alert alert-info">

			<p>RespondT respond()</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<p>Similar to <b>compute()</b>, one may implement <b>respond()</b> to return different fields of a vertex in different supersteps.</p>
		
	</div>
