Consider the <i>Worker</i> class in \"basic/Worker.h\", and consider the function <i>Worker::sync_graph()</i>. During data loading, each worker process reads a fraction of the input and converts the lines to vertices. However, a vertex <i>v</i> loaded by a worker <i>w<sub>i</sub></i> may have <i>hash(v) = w<sub>j</sub></i>, and thus, <i>w<sub>i</sub></i> needs to send <i>v</i> to <i>w<sub>j</sub></i> before graph computing. In other words, workers need to exchange vertices to ensure that they hold the vertices that they are responsible for. This is done by <i>Worker::sync_graph()</i>, where vertex exchange is done by the <i>all_to_all()</i> function (defined in \"utils/communication.h\") and vertices directed at other workers are deleted after being sent. Please check the function code for the details.</p>\		<p>The second place where the system deletes vertices is in the destructor of the <i>Worker</i> class. Please check the function code for the details.';		var vload_note = '<p>Here, we briefly explain how the system calls <i>Worker::toVertex(line)</i> to load the vertices. In HDFS, a graph is stored as a folder of files, where each file contains many lines each representing a vertex. During graph loading, the master will assign the files evenly to the workers, and each worker calls <i>Worker::load_graph(inpath)</i> (see \"basic/Worker.h\") for each file assigned. In <i>Worker::load_graph(inpath)</i>, the user-defined <i>toVertex(line)</i> function is called for each line of the file to parse it into a vertex object, which is appended to the worker\'s vertex set <i>Worker::vertexes</i>.</p>'		var vdump_note = '<p>Here, we briefly explain how the system calls <i>Worker::toline(v, writer)</i> to dump the vertices to HDFS. The result of a Pregel+ job is written to a user-specified output folder in HDFS, where each worker process calls <i>toline(v, writer)</i> for each vertex <i>v</i> it is responsible for, and writes the information of <i>v</i> to a file under the output folder. This is done by function <i>Worker::dump_partition(outpath)</i>. Worker <i>i</i> writes to files \"part_i_j\", where <i>j</i> = 1, 2, ... In \"utils/ydhdfs.h\", we define \"HDFS_BLOCK_SIZE\" to be 8M, and if the current file worker <i>i</i> is writing (let it be \"part_i_j\") has size exceeding \"HDFS_BLOCK_SIZE\", worker <i>i</i> creates a new file (i.e. \"part_i_(j+1)\") to write vertex information. The file splitting is automatically handled by class <i>BufferedWriter</i> defined in \"utils/ydhdfs.h\".</p>'		var combiner_note = '<p>The <i>Combiner</i> class is defined in \"utils/Combiner.h\", and the mentioned system-level message combining operation is implemented in <i>Vecs::combiner()</i> of \"utils/vecs.h\", which is called by the message buffer\'s <i>MessageBuffer::combine()</i> function defined in \"basic/MessageBuffer.h\".</p>\		<p>To achieve better performance, the actual implementation is actually a little bit different from the logic described. When vertices send messages, the messages are simply appended to the end of the message buffer; before being sent, the messages are sorted by the target vertex ID to form groups, and messages in each group are combined into one message using the specified combining function.</p>'		</script>

                <h1>Pregel+ Communication Primitives</h1>
            </div>
        </div>		<p>All the communication primitives of our system are defined in <b>utils/communication.h</b>. These functions are implemented using MPI, and are called by the system (e.g., in worker's <b>run()</b> function). If you want to change/extend the logic of our system, you may also need to call these functions.</p>				<p>The first set of functions aggregate the value of each worker, and returns the aggregated value.</p>				<div class="alert alert-info">			<p><b>Every worker calls: </b>int all_sum(int my_copy)</p>					<p><b>Every worker calls: </b>long long master_sum_LL(long long my_copy)</p>						<p><b>Every worker calls: </b>long long all_sum_LL(long long my_copy)</p>						<p><b>Every worker calls: </b>all_bor(char my_copy)</p>					</div>				<p>For example, in function <b>Worker::run()</b> of <b>basic/Worker.h</b>, evey worker executes <b>active_vnum() = all_sum(active_count)</b> to sum up the number of active vertices (i.e. <b>active_count</b>) local to the worker, and to obtain the total number of active vertices (i.e. the return value of <b>all_sum(.)</b>). This value is then used to decide the termination condition. For <b>master_sum_LL(.)</b>, the return value is only valid for the master process.</p>				<p>The second set of functions are called by the workers to exchange contents:</p>				<div class="alert alert-info">			<p><b>Every worker calls: </b>all_to_all(vector<T>& to_exchange)</p>					<p><b>Every worker calls: </b>all_to_all(vector<T>& to_send, vector<T1>& to_get)</p>					</div>				<p>Before calling the first function, one should make sure that <b>to_exchange</b> contains <b>N</b> elements of type <b>T</b> (<b>N</b> is the number of workers), where <b>to_exchange[i]</b> stores the object to be sent to worker <b>i</b>. After the function returns, <b>to_exchange[i]</b> stores the object received from worker <b>i</b>.</p>				<p>The second function is similar, except that the contents to send are stored in <b>to_send</b>, and the contents received are stored in <b>to_get</b>. However, for worker <b>i</b>, <b>to_get[i]</b> is empty and one needs to get the content from <b>to_send[i]</b>. If <b>T</b> is different from <b>T1</b>, we require that the serial representation of a <b>T</b>-typed object be the same as that of a <b>T1</b>-typed object (e.g., <b>vector<T></b> and <b>hash_set<T></b> have the same serial representation according to <b>utils/serialization.h</b>).</p>				<p>These functions are used by the system to implement the message passing logic, see <b>basic/MessageBuffer.h</b> for more details.</p>				<p>The final set of functions are called between master and the slaves to gather/scatter information:</p>				<div class="alert alert-info">			<p><b>Master calls:</b> masterScatter(vector&lt;T&gt;& to_send);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Slave calls:</b> slaveScatter(T& to_get)</p>						<p><b>Master calls:</b> masterBcast(T& to_send);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Slave calls:</b> slaveBcast(T& to_get)</p>						<p><b>Master calls:</b> masterGather(vector&lt;T&gt;& to_get);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Slave calls:</b> slaveGather(T& to_send)</p>					</div>				<p>The first pair of functions are called to let the master distribute contents to each worker. For the master, before calling <b>masterScatter(.)</b>, <b>to_send[i]</b> stores the object to be sent to worker <b>i</b>. For each slave, after calling <b>slaveScatter(.)</b>, <b>to_get</b> stores the object received from the master.</p>				<p>The second pair of functions are similar, except that the master sends the same content <b>to_send</b> to all slaves.</p>				<p>The third pair of functions are called to let the master gather contents from each worker. For each slave, before calling <b>slaveGather(.)</b>, <b>to_send</b> stores the object to be sent to the master. For the master, after calling <b>masterGather(.)</b>, <b>to_get[i]</b> stores the object received from worker <b>i</b>.</p>				<p>These functions are used by the system to implement the aggregator logic, see <b>Worker::agg_sync()</b> in <b>basic/Worker.h</b> for more details.</p>
